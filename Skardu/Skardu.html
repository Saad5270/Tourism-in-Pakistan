        <p>A domestic airport is situated in the lovely city of Skardu, which is the administrative center of the Skardu District in Gilgit-Baltistan. Two asphalt runways are part of the airport complex, however only one is now in use. This airport's operational runway, which is around 12,000 feet long, is thought to be the longest in Pakistan. The other runway at Skardu Airport is roughly 8,740 feet in length.

            This airport's apron can accommodate up to three Boeing 737 planes at once. The most modern Oshkosh ARFF specialized airplane rescue and firefighting vehicles are also available at the airport. Currently, two daily ATR42 flights operated by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) connect Skardu Airport with Islamabad International Airport. It takes roughly 45 minutes to fly from Islamabad to Skardu and the other way around. More airlines are soon anticipated to start operating in Skardu, according to reports in local newspapers.
            
            The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority also oversees and runs the airport complex in Skardu, just like it does for all of Pakistan's other airports.
            
            This airport in Gilgit-Baltistan serves a lot of domestic and international travelers each year despite being very tiny. Many tourists and adventurers prefer flying to Skardu over driving there in order to explore the picturesque Satpara and Kachura Lakes, see the beautiful Manthoka Waterfall, go hiking in the Deosai National Park, visit the Shigar and Khaplu forts, or simply spend a few days at the world-famous Shangrila Resort. As a result, this airport significantly contributes to increasing tourism in the area.
            
            Since the airport is situated in a mountainous area, passengers can see the snow-covered mountain summits both when they land and take off. This airport is open from daylight till sunset during the summer. However, because of the significant snowfall during the winter, it must be closed.
            
            It's also crucial to note that plans are currently being developed to turn Skardu Airport into an international airport. Additionally, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority intends to upgrade this airport's terminal and add an air traffic control tower.</p>

            <p>One of the most well-known tourist destinations in Skardu is Deosai. To protect the life of several animal and bird species, including the Snow Leopard, Red Fox, Himalayan Brown Bear, Wolf, Golden Eagle, Sparrow Hawk, and Snow Cock, the Deosai National Park was created.

            Additionally, this park is well-known for its verdant meadows, vegetation, and fauna, as well as its snow-capped mountains, streams, and rich, wild flowers. Only in the summer is the National Park open to visitors, who are greeted with a breathtaking display of flowers and butterflies. Sheosar Lake, Bara Pani, Ali Malik, and Burgi La are a few stunning locations in Deosai.</p>
